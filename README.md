# Exoplanet Detection 

The main problem with the  data generated by the __Kepler Space Telescope__is that a lot of exoplanets are revealed false positives.
The project consists of identifying exoplanets using random forest model, which is analyzed in order to determine which features are relevant.
The hyperparameters are optimized with techniques that come from the __AutoML__ research and are cross-validated with __Hyperband__
